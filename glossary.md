# The AI Glossary

**Welcome to the vocabulary of my AI Playground.**

As I navigate the world of Artificial Intelligence, I'm quickly realizing that half the battle is learning the language. This glossary serves as my personal knowledge bank, a living collection of terms, acronyms, and concepts I encounter along the way. My goal is to define these not just by the textbook, but in my own words, turning complex jargon into clear, actionable knowledge.

## A

### Algorithm
**Simple Definition:**
A specific set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task. Like a cooking recipe for a computer.

**Technical Note:**
In classical computing, algorithms are explicitly programmed by humans. In Machine Learning, the computer often "learns" the algorithm itself from data.

**Context:**
The original Pac-Man ghosts followed simple, deterministic algorithms to chase the player.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
**Simple Definition:**
Also known as "Strong AI." A theoretical machine that has human-level intelligence, consciousness, and the ability to apply knowledge to any task, not just the one it was trained on.

**Technical Note:**
Does not currently exist. Current AI is "Weak" or "Narrow."

*Related: [[Weak AI]]*

## F

### Finite State Machine (FSM)
**Simple Definition:**
A model used in game design where an AI character can only be in one "state" at a time (e.g., "Chase," "Run Away," "Patrol") and switches between them based on specific triggers (like a timer).

**Technical Note:**
FSMs are deterministic and rigid. They do not learn; they just follow a flowchart of logic.

**Context:**
Used in Pac-Man. Ghosts switch from "Chase" to "Scatter" based on a timer, or to "Frightened" when a pellet is eaten.

## G

### Generative AI
**Simple Definition:**
A type of AI that can create *new* content (images, text, game levels) rather than just analyzing existing data.

**Context:**
Mentioned in the "Future of Pac-Man" research (NVIDIA GameGAN), where AI can generate the game itself.

---

## N

### Neural Networks
**Simple Definition:**
An approach to AI inspired by the human brain. It uses layers of interconnected "nodes" (neurons) to process information.

**Technical Note:**
This is a "Bottom-Up" approach. Instead of being given rules, the network learns patterns by processing vast amounts of data (training).

---

## R

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
**Simple Definition:**
A method of training AI where the computer learns by trial and error. It gets a "reward" for doing something right (like getting points) and a "punishment" for doing something wrong (like dying).

**Context:**
Modern researchers use Pac-Man to test RL. The AI plays millions of times, slowly learning that eating dots = good and touching ghosts = bad.

---

## S

### Symbolic AI
**Simple Definition:**
Also known as "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (GOFAI). The classical approach to AI based on clear, human-readable logic and rules (If X, then Y).

**Technical Note:**
It is a "Top-Down" approach. It works well for problems with clear rules (like Math or Chess) but struggles with messy real-world data (like recognizing faces).

---

## T

### Turing Test
**Simple Definition:**
A test proposed by Alan Turing to determine if a machine is intelligent. If a human talks to a machine and cannot tell it is a machine, the machine "passes."

**Technical Note:**
Critics argue this tests the ability to *deceive*, not the ability to *think*.

---

## W

### Weak AI
**Simple Definition:**
Also known as "Narrow AI." AI that is super-smart at one specific thing (like playing Chess or recommending movies) but useless at anything else.

**Context:**
All AI that exists today (Siri, ChatGPT, Tesla Autopilot) is technically Weak AI.
